    <p>NewsDeck brings you the top news feeds from around the world - and you can use simple, intuitive gestures to read exactly what you are interested in. NewsDeck was built within 2 weeks at my former company Mokko. This was one of our in-house projects so I was constrained by limited time.</p>

    <h5>Problem</h5>
    <p>One of the problems I always had while reading news is too much content, it's endless and it’s not good for your brain. So, NewsDeck was built out of a need to seek clean, minimalistic and easily consumable news reading experience. There were lots of apps out there for news reading, most of the apps were just endless scroll of news content dumped on your mobile screen so I decided to build my own version.

<div class="container-small text-content">
    <p>Whenever we’re reading a news we always have some sort of preference for news sources, news categories and we either want to read the latest or popular news content. So I wanted to keep these options easily configurable in the app.</p>
