<div class="container-small text-content">
    <p>I joined Omio (formerly GoEuro) as a product designer in March 2018. At that time GoEuro had still old brand and product experience which was very inconsistent. Later that year we were going through rebranding, so small start-up like team was formed dedicated to this project and I had an opportunity to be part of this team.

    <h5>End-to-end redesign</h5>
    <p>Goal of the project was to completely redesign web and app experience according to new brand. We kicked of project by auditing our product, collecting all page templates and components, then we started doing visual exploration on new styles. After couple of months of team work and lots of meetings, we ended up with new Omio experience.

<div class="container-small text-content">
    <p>During rebranding phase, I was also documenting all the design decisions that we were taking. As a result we had a collection of re-usable components library and styles guides which later helped team to scale up rest of product designs faster.</p>

    <h5>Omio design system</h5>
    <p>One more thing that came out of this project other than our new product experience was our own design language system.</p>

    <h5>Website for the design system</h5>
    <p>As a spin-off of this project, I now had to maintain and improve our design system which was growing with our product as well. One issue I saw initially after launching our redesign was lower adoption of our design system withing our compan and to fix that I decided to launch internal website to document our system.</p>
