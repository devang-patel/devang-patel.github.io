    <p>Tiffinity was a homemade food delivery startup co-founded by Mokko CEO. Startup was mostly operating in my hometown Ahmedabad. It was started with a simple mission to  serve fresh homemade food made by home chefs (mother/wife/husband) for their own families, available to the people who have to rely on restaurants & tiffin services.
