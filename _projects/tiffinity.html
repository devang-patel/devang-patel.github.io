    <p>Tiffinity was a homemade food delivery startup co-founded by CEO of my former company Mokko LLC. It was mainly operating in my hometown Ahmedabad, India. It was started with a simple mission to  serve fresh homemade food made by home chefs (mother/wife/husband) for their own families, available to the people who have to rely on restaurants & tiffin services.
